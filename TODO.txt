Remember to keep the to do list tidy, clean and easy readable.
We use a template. For each day specify the day, underline 
the date with = and type the to dos. When a task is not done
mark it with [TODO], if you're working on a task mark it with
[WORK] and when a task is done mark it with your name 
(AHAL, HCLK, MCHE). Two line breaks between each day.
Days are appended at the bottom.

Example:

dd.mm.yyyy

[WORK]	Make to do list.
[TODO] 	Make class X.
[TODO] 	Some long task that must be done but no one wants to
	because it's boring.
